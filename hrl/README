Install Instructions
--------------------

- Set the desired build path for the libraries in make.inc with the BUILDDIR variable
- Run make at the base of the hrl directory, with a 'nodpx' argument if no datapixx
  is module is required
- Add BUILDDIR/build/python to your PYTHONPATH
- Copy hrlrc from ./misc to your home directory (hide it with a '.' if
  desired)

Usage Instructions
------------------

Finding Documentation:

- Start IPython
- Import HRL: from hrl import *
- Create and hrl instance: hrl = HRL(...)
- Examine module documentation: hrl?
- Access HRL method documentation: hrl.method?
- Using IPython to interact with an hrl instance can be very helpful
  while designing an experiment.

Developing an Experiment:

- Create a directory under the experiments folder with your name. Push
  your experiment every once in a while so that other users can see.
  Pushing to the repository will be the easiest way for you to move
  between the datapixx computer and your own computer.
- My experiment is in experiments/sacha and is a good reference for how
  to design an experiment with HRL. You may want to copy it as a
  starting point for your experiment.
