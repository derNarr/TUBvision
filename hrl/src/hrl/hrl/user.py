### Loading Config ###


# Though this isn't an elegent solution, it seems as though environment
# variables aren't properly updated if the config file is read inside a
# function. So instead it is simply loaded here when hrl is imported. I
# should probably try to improve this, but it's relatively a non issue.

### HRL Class ###


class HRL:
    """
    HRL (High Resoultion Luminance) is module which provides a set
    of tools for assembling a psychophysics experiment using OpenGL to
    control the display, and DataPixx to control the datapixx graphics
    card and the ResponsePixx input box. This technology allows the
    presentation of stimuli with high temporal accuracy and contrast
    resolution.

    HRL wraps the control of a number of devices into one object of
    class HRL, and manages hardware based on a number of initialization
    arguments. So far this includes openGL, dataPixx, responsePixx, and
    optiCAL, and gamma correction. For a general overview see the module
    description.  Ideally, all programming should be possible through
    HRL alone, without the need to import OpenGL, pygame, or any other
    such core libraries.

    One of the key features of HRL is the generation and incorporation
    of gamma function data. In order to use this functionality, a few
    things need to be done. First, the gamma.py script must be used to
    sample from the monitor's intensity-luminance function. Second, the
    functions in hrl.lut must be used to generate a look up table. Then,
    on initialization an HRL object can read the look up table, and
    based on this table automatically linearize (by inverting the gamma
    function) the intensities of new textures created with HRL.

    Another feature of HRL is the ability to define a coordinate system
    however you wish. HRL accepts a coords 4-tuple corresponding to the
    (left,right,bottom,top) of the screen, and a flipcoords argument
    which when true means coordinates are given in (y,x) coordinates as
    opposed to (x,y). By default coords=(0,1,1,0) and flipcoords is True,
    producing a matrix style coordinate system, i.e. the y axis is the
    first value in the pair, and the top left corner of the screen is
    the origin. A coordinate system with the origin at the centre of the
    screen with the x axis as the first element of the tuple can be made
    with coords=(-0.5,0.5,-0.5,0.5) and clfip=False. Note that the only
    thing that this modifies entirely are texture size and position
    arguments.  Usage of other openGL functions for example may not work
    as expected.

    An optional aspect of HRLs functionality is the ability to
    automatically read design matrices, and print out result matrices.
    While this functionality is little more than a reexportation of
    python's csv package, it can still simplify the code of many
    experiment scripts. These features can be activated with the
    appropriate hrl initializaiton arguments. When activated, the
    corresponding HRL instance has the fields dmtx, and rmtx added to
    it. hrl.dmtx is an iterator over the lines of the design matrix and
    can be used for example in a for loop - 'for dsgn in hrl.dmtx:'.
    hrl.rmtx is a dictionary which is written to the result matrix file
    when hrl.writeResultLine() is called.

        Flips in the image backbuffer. In general, one will want to draw

        screen at once.

        Takes a clr argument which causes the back buffer to clear after
        the flip. When off, textures will be drawn on top of the
        displayed buffer.

        Also takes an optional duration (dur) argument. If dur != None,
        then the flip command will pause execution for the specified
        number of milliseconds, and then flip the empty buffer forward.
        i.e. if you don't use any other draw commands while it is

        is the delay between the initial call and the eventual button
        press.
        
        readButton also depends on an initial list of buttons. Only the
        provided button colours will register as a button press. If an
        unlisted colour is pressed, HRL will ignore it and the delay
        clock will keep counting.

        readButton also accepts a timeout, causing readButton to return
        none if this time is exceeded.

        Parameters
        ----------
        to : How long the readButton will wait for a response in
