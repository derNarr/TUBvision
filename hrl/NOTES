General:
- Right now users need to be part of the 'root' group in order to
  properly run the program.

Datapixx:
- Not properly closing Datapixx can result in problems. After not being
  properly treated, reading a button for example would produce garbage
  results and print a 'Mismatch Address' error. This problem could only
  be fixed by resetting the Datapixx.

Monitor:
- We had a strange effect that cost us time where the aspect ratio of
  images (their width) would change as a function of their x position on
  the screen. This turned out to be a result of the modeline. Ivan had
  copied the settings from the VSG system to the linux system, but this
  turned out to be the source of the error. It seems as though the VSG
  must modify these settings before passing them to the monitor, whereas
  the Datapixx passes them directly to the monitor. The original
  settings provided by Siemens are the correct ones.
- The luminance as a function of intensity changes with respect to the
  display size of the monitor. Typical maximum values for a properly
  sized screen are around 550 cdl/m2.
- The X session can be restarted by killing the X process with 'sudo
  pkill X' which is useful if you started the computer when the datapixx
  was off.
- There's a weird screen flicker that occurs every once in a while which
  looks like a lamp being shone from the inside of the screen. This is
  likely the explanation for the spikes in the measurement data.
